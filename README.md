# Real-Time Bag Counter Using YOLOv8 + Deep SORT

This project implements a real-time object counting system using [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) and [Deep SORT](https://github.com/levan92/deep_sort_realtime), specifically designed for CCTV footage where a camera is fixed toward a gate or entry zone.

The system counts objects (like bags or people) that enter and exit a **defined rectangular zone**. Counts are updated based on the **direction of movement** (entering from top or bottom).

## âœ… Features

- Multi-object tracking using **Deep SORT**
